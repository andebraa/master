Friciton is immensly important. 
whether the concern is moving or still objects, energy loss, heat transfer or wear and tear
friction plays a role in near everything we do.
Friction, along with lubrication and wear forms the larger field of study known as tribology.
This is very much a interdisciplinary field, spanning across more or less all natural sciences.

Since da vinci, friction not dependent on object, just friction coefficient

rate and state friction
The friction depends on time, coulomb saw this
 
- empirical model using state variable theta
- theta only dependent on Normal force, slip rate and state itself

Ageing and Real Surface Areas

The state varaible is at the heart of the issue. 

Friction is caused by covalent bonds in junctions where objects meet

real contact area -> number of covalent bonds
ageing -> normal force increases real contact area, and number of bonds

Fineberg Group

The behaviour of junctions is at the core. Fineberg found rupture fronts

- COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR, NEEDS MORE RESEARCH.

How Do We Model Friction?

Models such as the spring model is very scalable, can easily recreate macroscopic systems. 
But its a little less accurate, as we don't actually model the atoms

Although its the most accurate description of particle interaction, quantumn modeling is far 
too computationally intesive.
